# ucla-central-cm
The purpose of this repo is to centralize the various UCLA RHEL7 repos under one repo for testing purposes. The repo will try to stay faithful to UCLA's process and any additions or changes will be for compatibility's sake. 

That being said this repo will be for running EC2s in AWS, there may be some ec2 specific roles added for ease of use.
